## UX

### User Stories

- As a user visiting the site for the first time:
  - I want to be able to quickly understand the purpose of the site.
  - I want to click the navigation links to be taken to the correct section and also back to home for a better user experience.
  - I want the page to be in a predictable layout so that I can navigate it easily.  
  - I want to be able to hear a selection of the bands music.  
  - I want the websites design to match with the bands.
  - I want to be able to view information on tours and upcoming events.
  - I want to have a way of contacting the site owner/band for any specific questions/queries.
  - I want to have be able to view the page on multiple devices and have it scale properly.


### Project Goals

#### External user’s goal:
The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, listen to their music and possibly book them for shows.

#### Site owner's goal:
The band are interested in increasing their fan base and selling more tickets to gigs.

### Design choices
I chose a modern minimalist style to reflect the music of the band and to appeal to a younger audience.

#### Fonts
I did research on the fonts used in the 1975 band promo material. most of the fonts were custom made, however I found googles Questrial font family closely resembled the look of the custom fonts and suited my websites theme well.

#### Questrial font preview

#### Colours
The website focuses on a black and white aesthetic. I chose this due to the large amount of material the band produce in this style. I felt the source material would match in with this design well and feel like it works with the bands image.

## Testing 

### User Stories Testing

- As a user visiting the site for the first time:

  1. I want to be able to quickly understand the purpose of the site.

      On loading the page you are immediately shown the name of the band in the navbar and the band members images.

  2. I want to click the navigation links to be taken to the correct section and also back to home for a better user experience.

      Navbar clearly shows all available paged and allows the user to return to the homepage.
      ![Navbar](/assets/images/README-Images/user-story-navbar.png)

  3. I want the page to be in a predictable layout so that I can navigate it easily.

      As shown in other screenshots, the site has a very simple layout that is easy to navigate with a clear navbar layout.

  4. I want to be able to hear a selection of the bands music.  

      The music page contains an embedded video and music player to allow the user to access this while staying to the site.
      ![Music Page](/assets/images/Wireframes/desktop-2.png)

  5. I want the websites design to match with the bands.

      All images and fonts are used by the band in their promo material. I decided to give all my boxes the glow effect that features on their album cover, the black and white aesthetic also matches this.

  6. I want to be able to view information on tours and upcoming events.

      The Tour Page gives all this information, on the commercial version the buy now links would direct the user to the appropriate retailer.
      ![Tour Page](/assets/images/Wireframes/desktop-3.png)

  7. I want to have a way of contacting the site owner/band for any specific questions/queries.

      The Contact page allows users to directly message the site owner. The form has validation functionality to ensure the correct information is given. 
      ![Contact Page](/assets/images/Wireframes/desktop-4.png)

  8. I want to have be able to view the page on multiple devices and have it scale properly.

      The site has been designed and tested to scale well on all devices. Both Chrome dev tools and manual testing were used to check the performed as intended.


### Manual Testing

- All internal links and buttons checked

- Media checked to ensure it plays when requested

- Chrome devtools used to check on multiple device sizes

- Tested on Chrome and Safari browsers

- Tested on Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Iphone 13 pro, Ipad, Samsung Note2 to ensure compatibility.

### Lighthouse Testing
Passed tests with a green score. Note - one test did give a yellow score for best practices which is explained below.

#### Desktop
![Desktop Lighthouse Test 1](/assets/images/Lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop1.png)

![Desktop Lighthouse Test 2](/assets/images/Lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop2.png)

Note - The lower score for best practices here is for the banner image resolution, however on bigger screens I found the quality was degraded when lowered, so for now this has been ignored.

## Bugs
- On some Iphones the background image scaling does not behave as expected and causes it to be larger than normal, from searching online and my own efforts it was unclear why this happened and no apparent solution was clear. As this is not a site breaking bug it I decided to leave it.
