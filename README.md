## UX

### Project Goals

#### External user’s goal:
The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, listen to their music and possibly book them for shows.

#### Site owner's goal:
The band are interested in increasing their fanbase and selling more tickets to gigs.

 
### Design choices

I chose a modern minimalistic style to reflect the music of the band and to appeal to a younger audience.
